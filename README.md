EnergyWork is the first pure proof-of-work token on Ethereum where **every token is minted directly from real electricity expended**.

No premine • No VCs • No allocations • Fair-launched on mainnet

In the coming age of AI abundance, goods become limitless. The final scarce resource is **energy** — watts turned into useful work.

EW embodies that truth.

### Key Features
- **Bitcoin-style emission**: Starts at 50 EW per block → halves every 210,000 mines → converges to ~21 million total supply
- **Browser-mineable**: Works on any laptop — no special hardware needed
- **Fixed low difficulty**: Early energy claims the asymmetric reward
- **Immutable vision**: Elon Musk's quote etched forever on-chain
- **Fully verified & transparent**: Source code verified on Etherscan

### Live Miner
👉 [**Mine Now — Instant Browser Mining**](https://sativuscrocus.github.io/energywork-miner/energywork-miner.html)

1. Open the link above
2. Connect MetaMask (Ethereum Mainnet)
3. Paste the contract address if needed:  
   `0xb5e3fe1a9118f5ec13e36ddcb3c1d600a01918`
4. Click **Start Mining**
5. Watch your CPU turn electricity into EW

Current block reward: **50 EW** (early era — claim it while it lasts)

### Contract
- **Address**: [`0xb5e3fe1a9118f5ec13e36ddcb3c1d600a01918`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb5e3fe1a9118f5ec13e36ddcb3c1d600a01918)

- **Verified Source**: Exact match ✅
- **Creator**: 0x59e0239e... (fair launch — no special privileges)

### Why This Matters
Bitcoin showed energy → digital scarcity.  
EW takes it further: a lightweight, accessible primitive for the post-scarcity world.

Early watts win the narrative.
